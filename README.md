🛠️ README.md: JARVIS-on-a-StickA fully portable, offline, and self-contained AI Assistant for your USB drive.This repository contains the architecture and implementation roadmap for building an AI assistant that lives entirely on a removable drive. It uses a portable Python environment, lightweight quantized LLMs, and local automation libraries to perform system tasks via voice or text.🧱 System Architecture1. The Portable CoreTo ensure the project runs on any Windows machine without installation, we use WinPython or a Python Embedded Distribution.Relative Paths: All file references are relative to the script location.Environment Isolation: We use a .bat launcher to set local environment variables (like PATH and HOME) to the USB drive only.2. The "Brain" (LLMs)We use GGUF-quantized models to balance performance and memory usage on standard CPUs.Phi-3 Mini (3.8B): High reasoning capability in a small footprint.Llama-3.2 (1B/3B): Optimized for low-resource efficiency.TinyLlama-1.1B: The "speed demon" for simple intent classification.3. Voice & AutomationVosk: Lightweight, offline Speech-to-Text (STT). No API keys needed.pyttsx3: Offline Text-to-Speech (TTS) using native OS drivers.PyAutoGUI & Subprocess: For "Function Calling" (opening Chrome, Word, or managing files).📅 4-Week Implementation PlanWeek 1: Foundations & EnvironmentGoal: Set up the portable USB environment.Tasks:Format a high-speed USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive (NTFS recommended).Download and extract WinPython or Python Embedded to /env.Create a launch.bat to verify the environment works without system Python.Hardware Check: Ensure your drive has at least 300MB/s read speed for fast model loading.Week 2: Intelligence & InferenceGoal: Get the LLM running locally.Tasks:Install llama-cpp-python (CPU version) into your portable environment.Download Phi-3 Mini or Llama-3.2-3B in GGUF format (4-bit or 5-bit quantization).Build a basic script to take text input and generate an LLM response from the USB.Week 3: Voice & Function CallingGoal: Give JARVIS "ears" and "hands."Tasks:Integrate Vosk for offline voice transcription.Implement Function Calling logic: Define Python functions for open_app(name) and system_status().Prompt the LLM to output JSON (e.g., {"task": "launch", "target": "chrome"}) instead of plain text.Week 4: Synthesis & UIGoal: Polish the experience and "JARVIS" persona.Tasks:Add pyttsx3 so the assistant speaks back to you.Create a "Wake Word" listener or a simple Terminal UI.Optimize loading times by pre-loading the model into RAM on startup.Final testing on different "Guest" PCs.💾 Hardware RecommendationsTo avoid lag, your pen drive choice is critical:ComponentMinimumRecommendedDrive InterfaceUSB 3.0USB 3.1 / 3.2 Gen 2Read Speed100 MB/s400 MB/s+ (NVMe-based USB)Capacity32 GB64 GB - 128 GBHost RAM8 GB16 GB+🚀 Future Roadmap[ ] RAG: Add a local vector database (ChromaDB) for personal file "memory."[ ] Vision: Integration with a portable webcam for object recognition.
